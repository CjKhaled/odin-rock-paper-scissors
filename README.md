<h1>Project: Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
Simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors made for the odin project curriculum

<h2>What I learned</h2>
- Simple DOM manipulation using selectors and listeners to make the UI interactive. <br/>
- Git workflow of creating 'test' branches that can later be marged with the main branch.
